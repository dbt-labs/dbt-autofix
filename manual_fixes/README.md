# Problems that cannot be automatically fixed

## WHAT
This directory enumerates the things that projects might need to do to be compliant with the new authoring layer that autofix cannot do

## LAYOUT

There is one file in this directory for each problem that requires "manual" intervention.

Each file has these sections, at a minimum:
- PROBLEM
- SOLUTION
- CHALLENGES

## CONTRIBUTING

We welcome anyone who has experienced another class of problems requiring manual remediation to add to this directory!
